GANYMEDE FILE SERVER - HOST INSTALLATION MANUAL
=====================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Ganymede is a simple file sharing server that allows you to share files from
your computer with others over the internet. It creates a secure, password-
protected website that others can access to download files you place in a
specific folder.

PREREQUISITES
------------
1. Node.js (v14 or newer) - Download from https://nodejs.org/
2. A computer that can remain powered on while sharing files
3. Basic knowledge of command line/terminal usage

INSTALLATION
-----------
1. Open a command prompt/terminal and navigate to the folder where you want 
to install Ganymede.

2. Clone the Ganymede repository from GitHub:
    git clone https://github.com/maharava/ganymede.git

3. Navigate into the cloned repository:
    cd ganymede

3. Open a command prompt/terminal in this folder and run:
   npm install

   This will install all required dependencies.

CONFIGURATION
------------
Create or edit the .env file with a text editor and configure:

1. PORT (optional, default is 3000):
   PORT=3000

2. USER CREDENTIALS (username:password format, comma-separated):
   USER_CREDENTIALS=username1:password1,username2:password2

   Example:
   USER_CREDENTIALS=jimminy:cricket,boob:mcboobs

3. GREETING MESSAGES (optional):
   GREETING_HEADER=Hi, {username}! I'm Ganymede
   GREETING_SUBHEADER=Want some of my files? Yeah you do:
   GREETING_EMPTY=I got nothing! Tell whoever owns me to put files in the "shared_files" directory.

   Note: {username} will be replaced with the logged-in user's name.

CUSTOMIZING THE APPEARANCE
-------------------------
1. The "assets" folder is included in the Ganymede repository and contains 
default assets.

2. To customize the appearance, replace the following files in the "assets" 
folder:
    - Background images (1920x1080px recommended):
      - For all users: assets/background.png
      - For specific users: assets/background_username.png
         (Example: assets/background_jiminy.png for user "jiminy")

    - Favicon (optional):
      - assets/ganymede.ico

SHARING FILES
------------
1. Open the "shared_files" folder in your Ganymede directory:

2. Place any files you want to share in this folder.
   - These will be available to anyone with login credentials
   - There are no folder hierarchies - all files must be in this root folder

RUNNING THE SERVER
-----------------
1. On Windows: Double-click start-ganymede.bat
   On Mac/Linux: Run "node ganymede.js" in terminal

2. The server will display:
   - Your local address (http://localhost:3000)
   - Your public IP address
   - A tunnel URL (https://something.loca.lt)

3. IMPORTANT: The tunnel URL is how others will access your files.
   Make note of this URL to share with your users.

SHARING ACCESS WITH USERS
------------------------
To allow users to access your file server:

1. Share with them:
   - The tunnel URL (displayed when you start the server)
   - Their username and password (that you configured in .env)
   - Your public IP address (they'll need this as a tunnel password)

2. When they access the URL, they will:
   - First be prompted for the tunnel password (your public IP)
   - Then be prompted for their Ganymede username/password

SECURITY NOTE
------------
- Anyone with the tunnel URL, your public IP, and valid credentials can 
access your shared files
- Only share credentials with people you trust
- The server is only active while running on your computer
- Files are served directly from your computer's storage
- It's recommended to close Ganymede when not in use

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
1. "Cannot find module" errors:
   - Run "npm install" again in the Ganymede directory

2. "Address already in use" errors:
   - Change the PORT in your .env file
   - Make sure no other services are using that port

3. Tunnel connection issues:
   - Restart the server
   - Check your internet connection
   - Your firewall might be blocking the connection

4. Files not visible:
   - Make sure they're in the "shared_files" directory
   - Reload the page
   - File names with special characters might cause issues
